# monthly-finance-dashboard
This early use of matplotlib and pandas was intended to help customize graphs to satisfy more nuanced specifications.

## Thoughts
The idea is for the data to be extracted from the MRR data.xlsx file, thus allowing it to be updated by someone without knowledge of the code. The code allowed the additional flexibility required, over and above Excel.

## Improvements
Had I continued to pursue a quasi finance and coding career, I would have added more graphs to the plots, and looked into improving the appearance of the graphs using Seaborn.

## How to use

```shell
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install openpyxl
python directory.py
```
